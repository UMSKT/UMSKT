### **FAQ**

#### **What does it do?**

* This program allows you to generate endless Windows XP / Windows Server 2003 keys.
  You also can use it to check your already existing keys.

#### **How does it work?**

* [Enderman's XPKeygen Readme explains everything in detail.](https://github.com/Endermanch/XPKeygen)

#### **How do I use it?**

* It all comes down to four simple steps:


### **Usage**
1. Feel free to use [XPKeygen](https://github.com/Endermanch/XPKeygen) on **Windows** to generate a key, and use such key during installation.

    * If on **Linux** please clone and compile this repository using `cd build && cmake ../ && make` and run using `./xpkey` to generate a Volume License Key

2. (For retail only): After installation, you will be prompted to activate Windows. Select the *telephone activation* method, then, run `./xpactivate <Installation ID>` using the installation ID that the activation wizard gave you.

3. Click "**Next**"

4. Profit!
